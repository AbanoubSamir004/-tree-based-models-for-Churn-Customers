# Tree-Based Models For Churn Customers

## use case:
- Churn problem is a data set of informtion about customer that we feed the the machine so it can tell use if he/she is going to leave or stay.
## Dataset:
- The Data set consistes of 14 columns with 10 features and one target, in the following we will demo each feature:

    1 - CreditScore : it represents the creditworthiness of the customer

    2 - Geography : is the countery were the customer is currently living

    3 - Gender : this obviously the customer gender (female or male)

    4 - Age : the customer age

    5 - tenure : period or duration for which the loan amount is sanctioned

    6 - Balance : jow much money the customer has

    7 - NumOfProducts : is the number of bank retail products the customer uses

    8 - HasCrCard : tells whether the customer has creadit card or no

    9 - IsActiveMember : the state of activation of the customer

    10 - EstimatedSalary : the annual salary of the customer
